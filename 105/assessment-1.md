I think the most important thing I learned this week was just the introduction and some of the basics of JavaScript. I think it was good to get a feel of what we would be learning right away and get familiar with the style and format of JavaScript.
What is the general idea of high and low level programming languages? High level languages provide a higher level of abstraction. This higher level of abstraction translates the language of the computer (binary) into a language that is more readable for the programmer. low level languages offer little to no abstraction from the language of the computer. This makes low level programming more difficult, as you have to write in binary, or in a language that provides a low level of abstraction from binary.
What are some of the pros and cons of the flexility with values and types in JavaScript. I think it can be very helpful and efficient at times, allowing you to write less code and making the code more readable. For example, as I was learning programming in C#, I needed to change the type of a piece of user input from type string to type int. To do this I had to write a line of code that changed the type of the input so that I could use that input. In JavaScript, that would not have been necessary, and that is just one example of many things that JavaScript does by itself automatically. On the other side, JavaScript automatically translating things that you write so that it doesn't produce an error can be very confusing. If you were, as a beginner, to write a piece of code incorrectly, instead of sending an error message, JavaScript might just read the code in a way that you didn't want it to. Instead of showing you the error you made, it would just give you the wrong output, forcing you to trace it back to where you made the mistake.
