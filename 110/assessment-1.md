Why is it important that HTML is an open standard controlled by a specification rather than being owned a one person or company? This makes HTML secure, reliable, and permenant.
If one organization owned HTML, they would have the freedom to apply a cost or fee, or discontinue HTML altogether. The reason that HTML was created the way that it was, is so
that no one person or company is able to do whatever they want with it.

What is the difference between an element and a tag? Elements are contained between an opening tag, and a closing tag. The tags sort of define the type of the element, and
determine what that element's role is in the program.
The format of an element is as follows: ```<opening_tag>element<closing_tag>```

In the following example, the text "This is a heading", is defined by the tag as a heading, and the text "This is a paragraph", is defined by the tag as a paragraph.
```
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph</p>
```
Explain the Yoda and Noam Chomsky quotes that were used in the lecture, and how they relate to writing HTML. The Yoda quote is a complete sentence that makes sense and gets its point across, but it is
formatted in an unconventional way (the syntax is incorrect). The Noam Chomsky quote, on the other hand, is completely formatted correctly, follows all the rules of the English
language, but makes no sense at all, and has no real meaning. When writing HTML, if you get the syntax wrong but get the semantics right, you will still get the result that you
expected, but the code may be harder to read. If you get the semantics wrong, you may have gotten the syntax right, but you won't get the result that you expected.
